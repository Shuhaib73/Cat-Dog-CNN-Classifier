# **Dog vs Cat Convolution Neural Network Classifier**

**Project description**

*This project revolves around the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, specifically distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The CNN algorithm processes input images, assigning weights and biases to different aspects of each image, enabling it to discern distinct features. Training the neural network involves using batches of labeled images, where the network's predictions are compared to the actual labels.*

**Project Goal**

*The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust image classification system capable of identifying whether an input image contains a cat or a dog. The CNN model is trained on a dataset containing images of both cats and dogs, with the aim of learning distinctive features that differentiate the two. The training process involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labels across batches of images. Once the training is complete, the model can be applied to new, unseen images, making accurate predictions about whether the input image features a cat or a dog. The flexibility of the implemented model allows for potential deployment on websites or various mobile devices based on specific requirements. The Dogs vs Cats dataset, available on Kaggle, serves as the foundational dataset for this image classification project.*
