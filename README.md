# **Dog vs Cat Convolution Neural Network Classifier**

#### **Project description**

*This project revolves around the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, specifically distinguishing between images of cats and dogs. The CNN algorithm processes input images, assigning weights and biases to different aspects of each image, enabling it to discern distinct features. Training the neural network involves using batches of labeled images, where the network's predictions are compared to the actual labels.*

#### **Project Goal**

*The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust image classification system capable of identifying whether an input image contains a cat or a dog. The CNN model is trained on a dataset containing images of both cats and dogs, with the aim of learning distinctive features that differentiate the two. The training process involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labels across batches of images. Once the training is complete, the model can be applied to new, unseen images, making accurate predictions about whether the input image features a cat or a dog. The flexibility of the implemented model allows for potential deployment on websites or various mobile devices based on specific requirements. The Dogs vs Cats dataset, available on Kaggle, serves as the foundational dataset for this image classification project.*

#### **Conclusion**

*In conclusion, the trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has demonstrated strong performance on the Dogs vs Cats dataset. After completing the training process with 15 epochs, the model achieved a remarkable accuracy of approximately 94.87% on the training set. This signifies that the model effectively learned the distinctive features of cats and dogs from the provided dataset.*

*it is essential to note that the model's performance on the validation set slightly dropped, resulting in an accuracy of approximately 82.90%. This divergence between training and validation accuracy could suggest potential overfitting, where the model may have become too specific to the training data and might not generalize well to unseen data.*

*In summary, the current model has demonstrated commendable performance on both the training and testing sets. With an impressive accuracy of approximately 94.87% on the training set and 82.90% on the testing set, it showcases its capability to effectively discern between images of cats and dogs. The slight deviation in accuracy between the training and testing sets is within an acceptable range, indicating that the model is successfully generalizing to new, unseen images.*
